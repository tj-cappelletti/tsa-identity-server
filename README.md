# TSA Identity Server - Archived
**This project is no longer being actively worked on.**

The complexities that came with running IdentityServer without a propper UI (which is locked behind a pay wall) provided to be far too time consuming.
Most TSA competitions run 2 to 4 hours so security, authentication, and authorization needs to be strong enough to avoid any obsscure attempts to break into the application.
The reality is it's faster to complete the compeition then trying to hack it.
